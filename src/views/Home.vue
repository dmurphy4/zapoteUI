    <h1>Welcome to Zapote Education</h1>
    <p style="width: 60%; margin: auto">Our mission is to provide a global platform for educators to collaborate and learn from each other.</p>
    <h3>How can Zapote be used?</h3>
    <div style="width: 80%; margin: auto">
      <p style="text-align: left">1. Like Dropbox, it's a place to store your materials in the cloud, to be accessed anywhere.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">2. Like GitHub, it's a place to make editing suggestions to your own and others' materials.</p>
      <p style="text-align: left">3. Also, you can store things privately or publicly. The hope is that public information will be used to help other educators have the opportunity to learn from you as you learn from them.</p>
